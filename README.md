# Montys-Hall
Based on the popular Monty's Hall teaser. 
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The user has the freedom to pick how many doors and games he/she wishes to play. The statistics of each door is printed after the simulastion is complete. It will show how many times each door had the prize. How many times switching won in opposed to staying. How many times each door was chosen along with how many times each door had the prize.
